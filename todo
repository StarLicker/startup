CSS:
- Add wrapping/text changes to conversion result
- Add some way to help separate history entries
- Darken some of the lighter yellow text colors

JS:
- Figure out how to sort leaderboards
- Add a visual and/or textual queue to tell the user when openai is processing request
- Disable all other buttons/links while conversion is processing

Node/OpenAI:
- Probably need to have 3 separate api calls for figuring out the
  measurements for each object and then the conversion itself

Other:
- Why does the history page logout function take you back to sign up instead of log in?
- Are there any ways to help history page load in quicker?
