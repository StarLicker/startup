*CS 260 Notes*

**Git Notes - 9/15/23**
- I started using Git and GitHub over the summer for my work, but this class helped me understand the difference between forks and branches.
- It was also really useful learning about the Personal Access Tokens and how to resolve conflicts. When I ran into conflicts at work I would always just delete my cloned repository and clone it again haha
