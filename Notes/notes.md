*CS 260 Notes*

**Git Notes - 9/15/23**
- I started using Git and GitHub over the summer for my work, but this class helped me understand the difference between forks and branches.
- It was also really useful learning about the Personal Access Tokens and how to resolve conflicts. When I ran into conflicts at work I would always just delete my cloned repository and clone it again haha

**Web Servers Info**
- Elastic IP: http://52.207.139.208/
- SSH command: ssh -i "C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\CS260_Server.pem" ubuntu@52.207.139.208
- Might need to upgrade from free tier t2.micro, but I can do this without changing the IP address now because I set up an elastic IP
